# ✨ Features
### 🚫 Built-in content blocking
* Luma comes with <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a> installed by default, which means you get all the benefits of uBlock without having to install it yourself.
  - To customize your Luma experience, you may--at any time--uninstall or disable uBlock. We highly recommend against this though, as you will lose most privacy benefits.
### 🧩 Extensions
* Luma has support for ALL extensions from the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">Firefox Addons store</a>, allowing you to customize Luma with custom themes or addons.
### 🔎 Private Searching
* Luma's default search engine is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, giving you a more private way to search the web.
### 👋 Goodbye Chromium
* Luma is a fork of Firefox, which means you are no longer feeding into Google's legal monopoly and are helping a smaller browser market.
  - **Did you know?** Most major browsers are based on Chromium (e.g. DuckDuckGo, Opera, Vivaldi, etc. which only helps Google dominate another tech field)
