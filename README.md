# ✨ Features
### 🚫 Built-in content blocking
* Luma comes with Luma Shield, a powerful content blocker to help you stay safe online.
  - To customize your Luma experience, you may--at any time--disable this blocker. We highly recommend against this though, as you will lose most, if not all, privacy benefits.
### 🧩 Extensions
* Luma, on release, will unfortunately not have support for extensions. However, the extension API will start to be developed starting with v1.0.0_alpha release and will be available soon after the browser's launch.
### 🔎 Private Searching
* Luma's default search engine is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, giving you a more private way to search the web.
   - You can change your default search engine in the Settings.
### 🤏 Small, But Powerful & Fast
* Luma uses WebView and (LANGUAGE), which allows Luma to be completely web complient and secure, while allowing for a small file size and speed.
